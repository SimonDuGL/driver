Will it look like James Cameron's 3D movie.  Avatars sleep in the control box. Do we all have to live like this? Warm houses could be chosen.

Through the internet of things, robots, smart phones, computer softwares, the  integrated and smart house is better. Then, the first thing we probably want to know is where the market is and how much it is. Therefore, we start with comparing each area in the US by analyzing the historical market data.
Here is the dataset available, Zillow Home Inc.

In the last decade(2009 -2017), the house price increased at least 42% in texas. Increase rate is almost twice that of the New York area, the financial center in the US.
![Slide12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101145370/165826651-73854c9f-acb4-48a8-9ea0-0980f3c3bfd7.PNG)

Texas:

270k – 190k = 80k

80k/ 190k = 42%

New York area:

310k – 250k = 60k

60k/ 250k = 24%(Relatively stable)


Although we can know from the picture that even the 3 bedroom house price in CA was higher than $280k, 13 years ago(2009), simply using the chart to compare states one by one seems not very efficient and easy-to-look. Then the geometry graph is needed.

Location classification:
mainland of the US could be classified by on the states or regions.

Although the population factor could be affected by birth rate and mortality, migration and foreign settlement, let us get a big picture about the population base. As we can see, California, Texas, New York, and Florida are more popular in 2010. And have less population in the Mountain area and West North Central area.

The 3 bedroom house Median price for last decade(2009-2017) in each states is relatively close and similar except the price in District of Columbia, CA and Massachusetts, a little high.In CA, 3 bedroom house price (from 2009 to 2017) increased 78%.

500k -280k = 220k

220/ 280 = 78%
![Slide17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101145370/165826786-10c76b99-f573-443e-a661-f0a13ee212ef.PNG)

The map is becoming brighter, meaning, most of the 4 bedroom house price in the US is 50k – 100 k more than that of a 3 bedroom house or that of the middle tier can accept. It also means the 4 bedroom house seems not affordable for most people in each state except New York.
![Slide18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101145370/165826788-ab91bdcf-98e5-41a2-86f7-f002cc0bd660.PNG)

In Washington DC, California, New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, 4, 5, or 5+ bedroom houses for buying or renting are very popular.
![Slide19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101145370/165826799-a2dd13b8-4045-4653-b56c-41f43b4e125f.PNG)

Median of price to rent ratio is taken for the last decade(2009-2017). States in red show that it is better to rent than to buy there. Seems because of the high price or population, CA is more appreciated for rent instead of buy.
Besides, another reason could be that the environment factor or less population in the mountain area contributes to higher rent ratio. But here are the exceptions. Although there are not many people in Nebraska, Mississippi, and Arkansas, these places are also good for buying a house.

Meanwhile, The color in West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Texas, Oklahoma is relatively stable though these pictures. Meaning these places are very popular. Besides, the house price is pretty fair. There is not much difference between tiers and classes. If the company wants to build houses for sale, they may need to build houses in these areas. And if the target market group is the majority, the construction company may choose to build less than or equal to 3 bedroom houses.

The time for sale in the west area is shorter than that of the eastern area, except Massachusetts and Virginia according to the Zillow data for all homes for sale or resale for the last decade(2009-2017).
![Slide22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101145370/165826837-cb069e46-c256-4e28-8274-b322658f2d4d.PNG)

In conclusion, if the company wants to build houses for sale and sell houses as quickly as possible, they need to build their houses in Texas.
![Slide23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101145370/165826841-d1dc5ff4-8e7f-45e1-98b9-eb1c7cb86127.PNG)

Even with such a stable market, the house market in Texas has also increased since August, 2020. 

Besides, the major preference could be reflected  through the difference between the price of houses sold and middle tier. According to the market data from Zillow since Oct. 2017 till March 2022, the single family residence house seems more popular than co-op house in Texas. The sale price of single family residence houses is 20% higher than that of cooperative houses.

50k/250k =20%

![Slide24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101145370/165826872-8180713c-2df1-4092-b025-74aefd3caf1b.PNG)

Based on the regression model, a 5 bedroom house price predicted is most likely between $618k(pessimistic) and $641k(optimistic). It is about $630k.

618k + (641k - 618k)/ 2 = 630k

Just the model could be improved by considering more public and private factors. For example, we do not know whether the cooperative buildings are more popular for rent. More features like tax assessment, detailed geographic location(e.g. Neighborhood, school and transportation) will be involved.
